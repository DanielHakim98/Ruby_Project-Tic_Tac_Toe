# Ruby Project: Tic_Tac_Toe

* This a project of ruby involving the use of object oriented programming.
* I know, this project will not be easy for me but I must do it in order to complete my The Odin Project course.
* Lately, I have temptation to give up on this and do something else, but I choose to not give up.

* I know to do some of the basics funcionality but I still need time to get the flow of the program.
* It's really difficult for because there's no clear flow on how the program will work.

* Add some functionality to update board. Might need redo all over again.
* Some functionality can be kept. But mostly, clear understanding about the game, flow chart of the program and pseudocode is important before coding.

* Finally, most of the error handling if user gives wrong input for marker has been solved and handled properly.
* One last funcitonality is to build condition of winners or draw is none of the users obtain straight row marks. There are 8 conditions could lead to win .
* The way I solved it by breaking down the game into smaller pieces and solve it one by one. It's also important to know the rough flow of the overall game.

* Add condition to win and draw for the game.
* The minimum functionality for the game has been completed.
* However, some improvement can be made including
  - [ ] Random first turn for the players.
  - [ ] Flexibility of using different markers.
  - [ ] Repeat the game (loop again) when the game has found the winner or the game is draw.
