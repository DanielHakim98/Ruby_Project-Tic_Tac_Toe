# Ruby_Project-Tic_Tac_Toe
* This a project of ruby involving the use of object oriented programming.
* I know, this project will not be easy for me but I must do it in order to complete my The Odin Project course.
* Lately, I have temptation to give up on this and do something else, but I choose to not give up.
