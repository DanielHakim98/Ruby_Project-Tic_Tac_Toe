# Ruby_Project-Tic_Tac_Toe
* This a project of ruby involving the use of object oriented programming.
* I know, this project will not be easy for me but I must do it in order to complete my The Odin Project course.
* Lately, I have temptation to give up on this and do something else, but I choose to not give up.

* I know to do some of the basics funcionality but I still need time to get the flow of the program.
* It's really difficult for because there's no clear flow on how the program will work.

* Add some functionality to update board. Might need redo all over again.
* Some functionality can be kept. But mostly, clear understanding about the game, flow chart of the program and pseudocode is important before coding.
